# Annotation Guidelines

Relevance grades:
- **0:** Not relevant.
- **1:** Slight lexical overlap but different meaning.
- **2:** Partially relevant or related theme.
- **3:** Directly answers the query.

Two annotators should grade each query. Compute Cohen's κ on a binarized scale where rel≥2 counts as relevant.
Keep guidelines short and clear, staying under ~40 lines.
